# edsdk-python

Python wrapper for Canon EOS Digital Software Development Kit, aka EDSDK.

Currently, it supports Windows only. But it shouldn't be difficult to adapt it for macOS.

# How to build

Once you were granted access - this may take a few days - download the latest version of their library.

## Copy the EDSDK Headers and Libraries

You should now have access to a zip file containing the file you need to build this library.

Unzip the file and copy the following folders inside the `dependencies` folder of this project:
1. `EDSDK` - Containing headers and 32-bit libraries (we only use the headers!)
2. `EDSDK_64` - Containing 64-bit version of the .lib and .dlls (which we do use!)

Your dependencies folder structure should now look like this:

```
dependencies/EDSDK/Header/EDSDK.h
dependencies/EDSDK/Header/EDSDKErrors.h
dependencies/EDSDK/Header/EDSDKTypes.h

dependencies/EDSDK_64/Dll/EDSDK.dll
dependencies/EDSDK_64/Dll/EdsImage.dll

dependencies/EDSDK_64/Library/EDSDK.lib
```

Any additional files aren't needed, but won't hurt either in case you copied the entire folders.


## Modify EDSDKTypes.h

This file contains an enum definition, called `Unknown`, which collides with a DEFINE in the `Windows.h` header.

Therefore needs to be renamed.

```c
typedef enum
{
    Unknown   = 0x00000000,
    Jpeg      = 0x3801,
    CR2       = 0xB103,
    MP4       = 0xB982,
    CR3       = 0xB108,
    HEIF_CODE = 0xB10B,
} EdsObjectFormat;
```

You can comment out `Unknown` or rename it to `UNKNOWN` (or whatever you want) or it won't compile on Windows.


## Build the library

Run:

```bash
pip install .
```
